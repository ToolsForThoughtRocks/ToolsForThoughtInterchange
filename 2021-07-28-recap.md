The July meeting featured three tool makers. Thanks to everyone for attending the talk, and for our three speakers for presenting.

The recording ended up over 1.5 hours, and we chatted a little off the record too. Lesson learned: leave some buffer time to spend more time hanging out with TfT people!

The video is on the event page and also on our new YouTube channel https://youtu.be/u-ib5IZnZu0
